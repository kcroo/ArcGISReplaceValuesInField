# ArcGISReplaceValuesInField

This custom tool is made using Python and the ArcPy package. It is used to update multiple values in a single field from one given value to another. It takes four parameters: a shapefile, a field, the data to replace, and what to replace it with. 

This tool was created to automate the monotonous task of updating multiple values in a field and to make it easy for someone with no programming knowledge to use. It will be used by a biological science technician to update a species code for an invasive plant from an outdated code to a new code for thousands of entires in a shapefile.
