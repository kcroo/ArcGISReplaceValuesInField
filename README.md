# ArcGISReplaceValuesInField

This custom tool is made using Python and the ArcPy package. It is used to update multiple values in a single field from one given value to another. It takes four parameters: a shapefile, a field, the data to replace, and what to replace it with. 

This tool was created for users who may not be familiar or comfortable with the Field Calculator. It automates the monotonous task of updating multiple values in a field and to make it easy for someone with no programming knowledge to use.
